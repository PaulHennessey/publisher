    You need to confirm who you are before you can help friends or family with their tax.

    To do this, you can create either a Government Gateway user ID or a GOV.UK Verify identity account.

    ^From 1 April you will not be able to use a Verify account to access HMRC digital services. Instead you’ll need to use Government Gateway.^

    ## Government Gateway

    You’ll need:

    - your National Insurance number or UK address
    - a recent payslip or P60 or a valid UK passport

    You can use your user ID for things like your personal or business tax account, Self Assessment, Corporation Tax, PAYE for employers and VAT.

    {button}[Choose Government Gateway](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/gg/sign-in?continue=/trusted-helpers&accountType=individual&origin=FANDF){/button}

    ## GOV.UK Verify

    GOV.UK Verify works best if you’re over 20 years old. You’ll need:

    - a UK address
    - a mobile phone
    - at least one valid photo ID from any country

    You can use your identity account for things like Universal Credit, requesting a basic DBS check and Self Assessment.
